```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employee’s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database
```

## Getting Started

You’ll need to use the [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries, the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to interact with the user via the command line, and the [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console.

Design the database schema as shown in the following image:

As the image illustrates, your schema should contain the following three tables:

- `department`

  - `id`: `INT PRIMARY KEY`

  - `name`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold department name

- `role`

  - `id`: `INT PRIMARY KEY`

  - `title`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold role title

  - `salary`: `DECIMAL` to hold role salary

  - `department_id`: `INT` to hold reference to department role belongs to

- `employee`

  - `id`: `INT PRIMARY KEY`

  - `first_name`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold employee first name

  - `last_name`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold employee last name

  - `role_id`: `INT` to hold reference to employee role

  - `manager_id`: `INT` to hold reference to another employee that is the manager of the current employee (`null` if the employee has no manager)
